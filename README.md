# Boston-Airbnb

## Tools used
Besides [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) of Python 3.7, I also used visulization tools such as [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/) and [gmaps](https://jupyter-gmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). In order to use gmaps in your local enviroument, a [Google API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) is reqired. Replace the Google API Key file path in the notebook with your own key.

## About the project:
This data analysis project is based on data provided by [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html). The [Airbnb Listings Data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) is orgnized base on municipality, and I will mainly focus on listings from the city of Boston for this version of the analysis. 

The findings of the analysis are devided into 5 sections: Neighborbood, Subway, Space, Price and Other Details. 

My Medium post base on the findings of the anaysis can be found [here](https://medium.com/@cheng.j.cui/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-airbnb-in-boston-4fefa054a786).
